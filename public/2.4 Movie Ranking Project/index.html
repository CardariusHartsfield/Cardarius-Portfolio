<h1>Greatest Movies Of All Time!</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>Django is one of the best action movies ever. Although it has some disturbing scenes and languages, the overall movie outside of those things are very rewarding. I highly recommend this movie.</p>
<h3>The Mist</h3>
<p>If you are lookin for a good horror movie, The Mist is a great choice. Originally written by Stephen King, The Mist will keep you on you toes for the duration of the movie.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>One of the best comedies in the 90's, Friday has a great cast that will keep you gasping for air. Friday is a generational comedy movie of all time.</p>
